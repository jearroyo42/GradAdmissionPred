# Econ110-Project

This project used the Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions

Our objective for this project was to leverage a range of academic indicators to predict the probability of acceptance for prospective graduate students. To achieve this, we employed a variety of econometric models on the dataset, aiming to gain insight into the factors which contribute to successful admission to graduate programs. Through careful consideration of various educational criteria, we were able to draw conclusions regarding the essential qualifications necessary for admission.

Our team utilized STATA software to create five separate econometric regression models, each designed to forecast graduate school admission probabilities based on student academic profiles. To enhance the accuracy of our results, we employed advanced techniques to mitigate heteroskedasticity in the econometric analysis, including the use of robust standard errors.

Our analysis ultimately yielded impressive results, with a robust R-squared value of 82% observed across all regression models, validating the efficacy of our approach in predicting prospective graduate students' chances of admission.
